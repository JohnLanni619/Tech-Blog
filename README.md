# Tech-Blog

## Description
The goal of this project was to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.

## Key Points
1. User is able to sign-up using email address and password
2. User is able to login after that
3. On homepage, user can see existing blogs that have been posted
4. User can click on the blog title to see the full post, as well as the comments and can leave a comment if they are logged in
5. When user clicks on dashboard, they see a list of their own existing posts and are able to create a new post as well
6. When user clicks on their existing posts, they're able to update the title or delete the post entirely
7. When user creates a new post, their dashboard is updated and the new post is populated there

** I was unable to get my app deployed to Heroku, so I'm including a demo video.
